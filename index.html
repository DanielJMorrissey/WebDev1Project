                        Did you know that <i>Manchester United</i> was not always called Manchester United? When it was <b>founded</b> back in 1878, the club was called <i>Newton Heath LYR</i> (<i>Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</i>). It was not until April or May of 1902 did Newton Heath change its name to the name we all know, Manchester United. The name change came after <i>John Henry Davies</i> invested in the club due to the fact that by 1902, Newton Heath had <b>few ties</b> to its origins. The first home ground that Newton Heath played on was <i>North Road</i> between 1878 and 1893. In 1893, they moved to <i>Bank Street</i> (also known as <i>Bank Lane</i>). Newton Heath stayed at Bank Street until 1910 where they moved to the <strong><em>best</em> stadium</strong> in the world, the <i>Theatre of Dreams, Old Trafford</i>.

                        <p class="part1a">
                            When the Football League was founded in 1888, Newton Heath did not think they were <em>good enough</em> to become founding members. They <b>waited</b> until 1892 to enter into <i>Division One</i> where they got <b>relegated</b> to <i>Division Two</i> in their second season. Twelve years later however, Manchester United were able to return back to the First Division and in the 1907/1908 season, they won the First Division for the first time and then went on to play in and win the first <i>Community Shield</i> (called <i>FA Charity Shield</i> back then).

                        <p class="part1a">
                            Manchester United performed well for a few more seasons and the following few decades the clubs performances were poor. It wasn't until the mid 1940s did Manchester United win a major trophy, all thanks to <i>Sir Matt Busby</i> taking the helm. He and Manchester United finished second place in the league on his first attempt and won the <i>FA Cup</i> the following year. Manchester United flourished under Matt Busby until tragedy reared its ugly beak. In 1958, the <b>Munich Air Disaster</b> happened. Eight Manchester United players died: <i>Byrne, Colman, jones, Pegg, Taylor, Geoff Bent, Liam Whelan</i> and fifteen days later, <i>Duncan Edwards</i>.

                            <i>Matt Busby</i> survived the disaster and despite all that happened, he <strong>rebuilt</strong> Manchester United. It was 1963 when Manchester United won their next major trophy. But that was not all that was notable about that season. It was also the debut season of one of the best players ever, <i>George Best</i>. George Best was the <strong>first</strong> football superstar, incredibly talented and as manutd.com put it, <q>a hit with the fans</q>. After ten years from the Munich Air Disaster, Manchester United won the <i>European Cup</i> (now called the <i>Champions League</i>). Soon after winning the European Cup, Matt Busby was knighted and then retired in 1969.

                            The next two decades were a <b>mix</b> for Manchester United but it was not until November 1986 did they hire the <strong>greatest manager</strong> to ever grace football, <a href='siralexferguson.html'><i>Sir Alex Ferguson</i></a>. It was under <i>Ferguson</i> that Manchester United's <b>unprecedented</b> success came from, <strong>winning practically every competition</strong> at least once (check the <a href='titlebetterthanliverpools.html'>trophy room</a>). At the end of the 2012/2013 season, Sir Alex Ferguson announced his retirement and Manchester United haven't been the same since, having mixed results under <i lang='pt'>Jos√© Mourinho</i> and <i lang='nl'>Louis Van Gaal</i> and a poor season under David Moyes and it looks like another poor season is to unfold this season under <a href='olegunnarsolskjaer.html'><i lang='no'>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</i></a>.

                Did you know that 18 out of the 20 League titles that Manchester United won, the manager <b>was Scottish</b>? That's correct, <i>Scotland</i> has been very good to Manchester United. The managers of course were Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, with the remaining two coming from the English manager <i>Ernest Mangnall.</i>
