                        The Time <i lang='no'>Ole</i> was a Player
                    </h1>
                    <p class="part1a">
                        <i lang='no'>Ole</i> made his debut at the ripe old age of 17 for a Norwegian club called <i lang='no'>Clausenengen</i> in 1990. He performed well for <i lang='no'>Clausenengen</i> where he averaged more than a goal per game and aided in their promotion from the Third Division to the Second Division. <i lang='no'>Ole</i> stayed at <i lang='no'>Clausenengen</i> until late 1994 where he then joined <i lang='no'>Molde</i>.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="part1a">
                        At <i lang='no'>Molde, Ole</i> scored a total of 41 goals in 54 appearances. It was here that <i lang='no'>Ole</i> had his <b>first taste</b> of European football, playing in the qualifying round of the <i>UEFA Cup Winners Cup</i>. <i lang='no'>Ole</i> stayed at <i lang='no'>Molde</i> for a total of 2 years before joining the <strong>best club in the world</strong>, <i>Manchester United</i> in 1996. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="part1a">
                        <i lang='no'>Ole</i> was a surprise to many people as very few people knew of <i lang='no'>Ole</i> outside of <i>Norway</i> and expected him to be a back up to <i>Eric Cantona</i>. However, <i lang='no'>Ole</i> and <i>Ferguson</i> proved that <i lang='no'>Ole</i> would be very important to the club <b>scoring</b> 18 goals in 33 appearances in his first season and out of those 33 appearances, 25 were games he started. It was this season he <b>earned</b> the nickname <i>'Baby-faced Assassin'</i> due to his youthful looks and clinical finishing.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="part1a">
                        <i lang='no'>Ole</i> continued to score for Manchester United and <strong>scored the winning goal</strong> in the <i>Champions League</i> final against <i lang='de'>Bayern Munich</i> in 1999, the Treble winning season. However by the turn of the millennium, opportunities became limited for Ole as the likes of <i lang='nl'>Ruud Van Nistelrooy</i> joined Manchester United and then followed by seasons <b>plagued with injuries</b>. It wasn't until August 2006 that he made a proper return to the <i>Premier League</i>. This season proved to be his <b>last season</b>, not only for Manchester United but also for his playing career.

                        <i lang='no'>Ole</i>'s Time as a Manager
                    </h1>
                    <p class="part1a">
                        <i lang='no'>Ole</i> first started off coaching the <i>Manchester United Reserves</i> in May 2008. He won the 2007-08 <i>Lancashire Senior Cup</i> by defeating the <i>Liverpool Reserves</i> 3-2. A couple of years later, <i lang='no'>Ole</i> won the <i>Manchester Senior Cup</i>. During his time with Manchester United Reserves, he was offered to take over as manager for the <i>Norwegian National Team</i> but he declined as he believed he was <strong>not ready</strong> for such an undertaking. <i lang='no'>Ole</i> resigned as manager of the Reserves in December of 2010 and <b>became manager</b> of <i lang='no'>Molde</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="part1a">
                        At <i lang='no'>Molde</i>, it took 3 games for <i lang='no'>Ole</i> to get his first win and went on to win the <i lang='no'>Tippeligaen</i> (the Norwegian equivalent of the <i>Premier League</i>) in his first season as manager. <i lang='no'>Molde</i> won the <i lang='no'>Tippeligaen</i> twice under <i lang='no'>Ole</i> and the <i>Norwegian Football Cup</i> once. In January of 2014, <i lang='no'>Ole</i> was announced as the manager of <i>Cardiff City</i>. Even though <i lang='no'>Ole</i> won his first game against <i>Newcastle</i>, Cardiff struggled to get points in the Premier League, winning a total of 30 points and Cardiff City finished 20th in the Premier League. <i lang='no'>Ole</i> started the next season at Cardiff poorly in the <i>Championship</i> where he left in September and returned to <i lang='no'>Molde</i>.

                        Upon his return to <i lang='no'>Molde</i>, the clubs performances improved, coming from a mid-table team to <strong>challenging</strong> for the title. But <i lang='no'>Molde</i> never won the League during <i lang='no'>Ole</i>'s second spell as manager there. After Manchester United sacked <i lang='pt'>Mourinho</i>, <i lang='no'>Ole</i> initially took charge of Manchester United as caretaker manager. <i lang='no'>Ole</i>'s first few months as caretaker manager was incredible. Manchester United went on an unbeaten run until the middle of February 2019, where they lost 2-0 to <i lang='fr'>Paris Saint-Germain</i> (aka <i>PSG</i>) at home in the first leg of the Champions League Round of 16 tie but went on to knock out PSG i the second leg. In March, <i lang='no'>Ole</i> <b>became the permanent manager</b> signing a three year contract. Since then, the clubs form has gone downhill and the 2019/2020 season is looking to become a poor season but there is some hope in the works as Manchester United are still in a period of transition and if given enough time from the <b>idiotic business men</b> in charge, Manchester United may get back to winning ways.
