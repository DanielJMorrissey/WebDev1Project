                        <i>Sir Alex Ferguson</i> first started as a <b>striker</b> for <i>Queens Park</i> (not to be confused with <i>Queens Park Rangers</i>) in 1957. Despite <strong>scoring regularly</strong> for Queens Park, <i>Ferguson</i> could not <b>hold a regular spot</b> on the first team (he scored 20 goals in his 31 appearances for Queens Park). As a result, he made a move to <i>St. Johnstone</i> in 1960. Again, Ferguson was a <strong>regular goal scorer</strong> for St. Johnstone but still could not hold a regular spot and it was because of this that he asked for a transfer on quite a few occasions. He even considered moving to <i>Canada</i> of all places. However, St. Johnstone couldn't sign a new forward so Ferguson stayed. He was selected to play against <i>Rangers</i> where <b>he scored a hat-trick</b> in a surprise victory.

                    <p class="part1a">
                        The summer after, <i>Dunfermline</i> managed to obtain his signature and it was here where Ferguson <b>become a proper professional footballer</b>. Dunfermline became one of the favourites to win the <i>Scottish League</i> but could only manage second place, losing out by one point. The season after, Ferguson became one of the <b>top scorers</b> in the Scottish League, scoring an impressive 45 goals in 51 games. In 1967, Ferguson moved to Rangers. A surprising move due to his <b>wife being catholic</b>. He performed reasonably well, scoring 25 goals in 41 games. However, he was blamed for Rangers losing the 1969 Scottish Cup Final to Celtic and was dropped to the club's junior side. This lead to him leaving Rangers. Ferguson rejected a move to <i>Nottingham Forest</i> as his wife was not keen on a move to <i>England</i> so he signed for <i>Falkirk</i>. He gained many more appearances and eventually was <strong>promoted</strong> to player-coach. When <i>John Prentice</i> became manager at Falkirk however, he <b>removed</b> Ferguson's coaching responsibilities and Ferguson requested a transfer. He then joined <i lang='gd'>Ayr United</i> where he retired as a footballer in 1974.

                        Time as a Manager
                    </h1>
                    <p class="part1a">
                        In 1974, Ferguson was <b>appointed manager</b> for <i>East Stirlingshire</i>. Even though he was working part-time, Ferguson became known as a <b>disciplinarian</b> scaring even <i>Bobby McCulley</i>, who claims that Ferguson was the only person to ever scare him. Ferguson didn't stay at East Stirlingshire for long. In the same year, he then became manager for <i>St Mirren</i>. Ferguson <strong>transformed</strong> this team, turning them from a team in the lower half of the <i>Second Division</i> to champions of the <i>First Division</i> in 1977. However, St Mirren became the only club to sack Ferguson and this was mainly due to <b>breaches</b> in his contract in 1978. After managing St Mirren, Ferguson went on to manage <i>Aberdeen</i>. It took a couple of years before Ferguson brought silverware to Aberdeen, winning the <i>Scottish League</i> with a 5-0 win on the final day. This was the first time in 15 years that the Scottish League was won by a team other than Rangers or Celtic. He was still a strict disciplinarian where he earned the nickname <i>'Furious Fergie'</i>. Ferguson then built on his teams success by winning the Scottish Cup. In the 1982-1983 season, Ferguson brought even more success where Aberdeen won the <i>European Cup Winners Cup</i> defeating <i>Real Madrid</i> 2-1. He then went on to win the <i>European Super Cup</i> beating <i>Hamburger SV</i> 2-0 over two legs. After, Ferguson then went on to win trophies a number of times before leaving for Manchester United. However before he left Aberdeen, Ferguson was part of the coaching staff of the <i>Scottish National team</i> and then became the manager during the <i>World Cup</i>. He appointed <i>Archie Knox</i> as his co-manager. When Scotland failed to progress past the group stages of the competition, he <b>stepped down</b> as manager.

                        At <i>Manchester United</i>, it wasn't until the 1989-1990 season did <i>Fergie</i> win his first silverware, the FA Cup. Before winning the FA Cup, it was a time of transition for United where overall the teams performances were improving and it is often cited that FA Cup win was the trophy that saved his career at Old Trafford. A few years later, Manchester United won the league for the first time in 26 years. From here on, Ferguson will obtain <b>unprecedented success</b>, including the Treble in the 1998-1999 season. You can see the list of trophies won by clicking this <a href='titlebetterthanliverpools.html'>link</a>. In 2013, Ferguson <b>retired</b> from management and Manchester United are still <b>looking</b> for a winning formula ever since.
